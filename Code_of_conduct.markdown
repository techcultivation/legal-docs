# Code of conduct


## Introduction

As an ethical or­gan­i­sa­tion and as an open com­mu­ni­ty our guid­ing prin­ci­ples are respect for the in­di­vid­u­al, the right to self­-de­ter­mi­na­tion, the right to ­make informed de­ci­sions and the spir­it of co­op­er­a­tion. We aim to be a safe and in­clu­sive en­vi­ron­men­t, fos­ter­ing a rich di­ver­si­ty of hu­man tal­en­t. The _Code of con­duct_ is a cod­i­fi­ca­tion of the eth­i­cal and pro­fes­sion­al be­hav­iour ex­pect­ed of those en­gag­ing with our ac­tiv­i­ties.

The _Code of con­duct_ is based (mu­tatis mu­tan­dis) on the 2016 ver­sion of the [IEEE Code of Ethics][coc_ieee], as es­tab­lished by the In­sti­tute of Elec­tri­cal and ­Elec­tron­ics En­gi­neers through its Ethics and Mem­ber Con­duct Com­mit­tee. ­Main­tain­ing the Code of con­duct is the re­spon­si­bil­i­ty of the board of the Center for the Cultivation of Technology, but the de­mand, am­bi­tion and knowl­edge to do the very best we can is shared through­out our com­mu­ni­ty. Any­one is there­fore en­cour­aged ­to con­trib­ute sugges­tions how to im­prove the Code of con­duc­t.

1. to avoid re­al or per­ceived con­flicts of in­ter­est when­ev­er pos­si­ble, and to dis­close them to af­fect­ed par­ties when they do ex­ist;

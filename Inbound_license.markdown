# Inbound license for projects under the CCT (v0.1)
___TODO: rename to “Entrusting intangible assets” or something similar?___

___TODO: what copyright aggregation is and why it’s useful___

The Center for the Cultivation of Technology [CCT] is able to act as an asset 
steward, holding intangible assets – such as copyright, trade marks, patents, 
databases etc.

___TODO: also integrated circuit layout design, 3D design, other stuff? ___

In case a project wants to entrust the CCT to handle its intangible assets we 
assure that the entrusted assets will forever remain Free and Open to you and 
to the public at large.

___TODO: define Free and Open___

To achieve this, we use the following legal tools:


## Copyright and patents

To assign copyright and patents we use the ___fla-2.0___ – an agreement that 
guarantees 

____TODO: link to outside tool 
(e.g. <http://contributoragreements.org/chooser/> after it gets FLA 2.0 
integrated) or copy the whole agreement hereinto___


## Trade marks, circuit layout design, databases etc.

___TODO: the FLA an most other CLA/CAA don’t cover this, figure it out___

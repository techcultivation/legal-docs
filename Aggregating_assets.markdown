# Aggregating intangible assets

Sometimes it makes sense for intangible assets to be gathered in a single entity. For example, this makes potential future re-licensing much easier, should a project need to adapt to new circumstances. Another example is that should a contributor suddenly not be available any more (e.g. due to changes in his life, or even death), the Center for the Cultivation of Technology could make sure that his code can live on instead of being trapped in a legal limbo.

The Center for the Cultivation of Technology is able to act as an asset steward, holding intangible assets – such as copyright, trade marks, patents, data bases etc.

In case a project wants to entrust the Center for the Cultivation of Technology to handle its intangible assets, we assure that the entrusted assets will forever remain free and open to you and to the public at large.

To achieve this, we use the following legal tools:


## Copyright and patents

To aggregate copyright and patents we use the [Fiduciary License Agreement 2.0][fla2] (FLA-2.0), which is a unique contributor agreement, created by the [Free Software Foundation Europe][fsfe] with the goal to provide a well-balanced contributor agreement that takes into account the interest of the developers as well as the wider community.

The FLA assures that the outbound license of the project will forever remain free and open. For more information on outbound licensing preferences of the Center for the Cultivation of Technology see the [Outbound licensing][outbound] document.

For projects that wish to aggregate copyrights (and patents) through the Center for the Cultivation of Technology, we ask all contributors to sign the FLA-2.0.

When a project is applying the FLA-2.0, it should make sure to select only one of the licensing options stated in _§4. License obligations by Us_ and remove the wording of the option(s) not used (see comments in [the MarkDown version of the text][fla2]).

## Trade marks

For any trade (or service) marks that the Center for the Cultivation of Technology would hold, we will work together with the project to come up with a good trade mark policy, to ensure how the project’s community may use the trade mark.

A good starting point is the <http://fossmarks.org/> website.


## Code audit

Before deciding to hold intangible assets of a project, the Center for the Cultivation of Technology may request to audit the project for e.g. code provenance, licenses used and potential trade mark issues.

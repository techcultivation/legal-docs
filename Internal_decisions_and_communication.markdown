# Communication & internal decisions

This document sets forth the rules for formal communication between the project and the CCT.


## Formal communication

All formal communication between the project and the CCT shall be made in the English language and take place either via e-mail or the platform.

Contactpersons from both the project and the CCT are strong­ly recommended to use an e-mail ac­count that of­fers pro­tec­tion against iden­ti­ty theft through use of ap­pro­pri­ate stan­dards (such as [SPF][], [D­KIM][] and [D­MAR­C][]).

[SPF]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208
[DKIM]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7489
[DMARC]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6376


## Informal communication

The CCT may for practical reasons also run other communication channels, such as mailing lists and IRC channels. The communication on these is purely of informal nature.

Amongst others, such informal channels are:

- [#techcultivation on irc.OFTC.net](irc://irc.oftc.net/#techcultivation) IRC channel
- [CCT Lounge](https://lists.techcultivation.org/mailman/listinfo/cct-lounge) mailing list

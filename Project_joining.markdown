# Projects joining

This document describes the requirements and procedures for a project to join the Center for the Cultivation of Technology (CCT).


## Candidate project requirements

CCT’s goal is minimising project’s administrative overhead and therefore it aims at being as light-weight as possible itself in its requirements and obligations from the project.

Still, in order to properly represent and protect a project, we need it to meet some minimum requirements.

A CCT member project has to be released under a free and open license. For further details see [Outbound licensing][outbound] document.

The project has to agree and comply with CCT’s [Mission][mission] and [Bylaws][bylaws].

- project chooses a person to be the contact (by default: project lead) to CCT;
- Agreement with [Code of conduct][coc]

## Process

### First informal contact

Generally the process starts with an informal discussion between representatives of the project and board members of the Center for the Cultivation of Technology. Such discussions are of purely informational nature and do not constitute any obligation from either side.

………

### Formal application

- written application
- CCT board votes and approves

### Memorandum of understanding

- signs MoU (link to MoU template here), specifying the services offered (link to services if applicable)


    The parties accord to work together on $topic of project
    The relationship is non-exclusive; projects can have other fiscal sponsors or legal entities.
    CCT will provide infrastructure for collecting donations preferenced onto the project
    CCT is allowed to use name and logo on website and publications stating trademark and IP belonging to the project or whomever depending on license of the FLOSS project.
    The CCT will provide automated processes for projects, including but not limited to reimbursement, travel expenses, hardware costs, servers, rent contracts, contracting of developers, employment of developers, selling merchandise.
    The CCT is giving control of the money collected for the project to the project but allows to object if spendings do not accord to German taxation law and/or are in general illegal (e.G. buying drugs, weapons, etc.)
    The CCT will take x% of the donations as an overhead to pay for accounting, infrastructure, etc. This money will be deducted the moment it arrives at the CCT. There will be NO BILLING.
    The CCT can manage funds for the projects, support the project to get fundings and will help the project to create reports for the funders.
    The CCT or the project can cancel this contract 3 months preliminary lead time. The project has the option to spend the money available, name another non-profit institution (this can be an own legal entity founded by the project but it needs to be a non profit) to handle the available money, or leave the collected money at the CCT which will spend it for other projects. Money from grants need to be spent for the designated funding topic; if this is not doable within the time the contract will run till the end of the funding period and with the final report to the funders. The possibility to collect donations will nevertheless end with the decision to cancel the contract.
    The undersigners for the project are signing on behalf of the project after internal decision making

# Outbound licensing

The Center for the Cultivation of Technology is there to foster the research and development of free and open technologies.

As such a CCT member project has to be released under a free and open license, regradless whether the CCT holds any intangible assets in it or not.

This document proscribes in further detail the outbound licensing options and obligations.


## Software

Any software that a CCT project releases has to be under a(ny) license(s) the [Free Software Foundation][fsf] classifies as [Free Software License][fs_license] and which are approved by the [Open Source Initiative][osi] as [Open Source licenses][os_license]

It is highly recommended to use a license that includes a patent clause.

[fs_license]: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list#SoftwareLicenses
[osi]: https://opensource.org/
[os_license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/


## Hardware

Any hardware released by a CCT project has to be be released under a(ny) license(s) explicitly suggested by the [Open Source Hardware Association][oshwa] in its [best practices][oshw_license]. Hardware-specific licenses, such as [CERN Open Hardware License][cern_ohl], [TAPR Open Hardware License][tapr_ohl] and [Solderpad Hardware License][solderpad_ohl], should be preferred.

It is highly recommended to use a license that includes a patent clause.

Also in general, the [OSHWA best practices][oshw_license] have to be followed, in order to make sure that the hardware is indeed open source.

## Other content

Regarding other content, the CCT would decide on a case-by-case basis whether the project’s license is free and open, but the [Free culture licenses listed on FreedomDefined.org][freedomdefined] are a good reference.

For the avoidance of doubt, from the Creative Commons list of licenses, we would only accept [CC0][cc0], [CC-BY][ccby] and [CC-BY-SA][ccbysa] of any version after 2.5, with a preference for later versions.
